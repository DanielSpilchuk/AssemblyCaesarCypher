# AssemblyCaesarCypher

This program is made in Assembly and has been testing/ran using the MIPS simulator QTSpim. 

First, two integers are given in the form of ##. Single digit numbers to be formatted as 0#. 
Loops are created to control the newLine, input, addition, and output. 

Wrap around is a special function to allow the ASCII code to go from Z to A instead of symbols.

This program will run until terminated through the use of a simple newline input.
